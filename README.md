# NDSS Astro Starter

Minimal GitHub Pages site that lists NDSS papers using data generated by a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Quickstart

1. Create a new GitHub repo and upload this folder.
2. Enable *Pages* with "GitHub Actions" as the source (Settings → Pages).
3. The workflow runs on a schedule and on demand (Actions → *ingest-and-deploy* → *Run workflow*).
4. Local dev:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Structure

- `scripts/fetch_ndss.py` — pulls NDSS entries from DBLP and writes `data/ndss/<year>.json`
- `src/pages/conf/ndss.astro` — renders the NDSS list, with simple search & year switch
- `src/components/PaperCard.astro` — card UI
- `src/pages/index.astro` — home page (add more venues later)

## Notes

- First publish will show an empty NDSS list until the Action runs and writes JSON files (a seed file for 2025 is included).
- You can manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab.
